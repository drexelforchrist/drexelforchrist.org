Creating an identity and building a brand take years.  In Campus Ministry terms, it takes at least a full generation to establish and refine a brand that is accessible and recognizable.  However, that identity can be tremendously tarnished in as little as one bad campaign.  

This document serves as the authoritative guideline on how to visually represent Drexel Students for Christ.  We think it's reasonable.  You should comply with both the letter and the spirit whenever you're representing Drexel Students for Christ visually. 

## Nomenclature Guidelines

When naming content, the careful selection of words is always important.  In order to convey meaning to those unfamiliar, we must avoid using insider language or "Christian-ese", and even must defer away from acronyms.  
 
Drexel Students for Christ should never be acronymized in any formal context, including the website and print.  The only permissible shortening is "Drexel for Christ" which is typically useful for tagging mass emails. 
 
## Logo and Wordmark Guidelines

The logo and logomark of Drexel Students for Christ brings with it a rich history of Campus Ministry on Drexel's Campus.  

There are three logo orientations and six classes.  The three orientations are:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Wide</th>
<th>Icon</th>
<th>Value</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<img src="https://cdn.drexelforchrist.com/formatting/logo/RGB_community_wide.svg" alt="Wide" style="height:6em; max-height:100px;" />
</td>
<td>
<img src="https://cdn.drexelforchrist.com/formatting/logo/RGB_community_icon.svg" alt="Icon" style="height:6em; max-height:100px;" />
</td>
<td>
<img src="https://cdn.drexelforchrist.com/formatting/logo/RGB_community_value.svg" alt="Value" style="height:6em; max-height:100px;" />
</td>
</tr>
</table>

In general, you should use the Wide orientation.  The text portion of the wide orientation is identical for all classes. 

The Icon orientation should be used only if the medium requires a simpler design, or if text is needlessly distracting.  For instance, the Icon orientation should be used at the bottom right corner of presentation slides, while title slides carry the wide orientation.  

The Value orientation is appropriate if and only if the logo is being used in tandem with other Value marks from other classes.  

The six classes reflect the six values of Drexel Students for Christ and are: 

<table>
<tr>
<td>
<img src="https://cdn.drexelforchrist.com/formatting/logo/RGB_church_value.svg" alt="Value" style="height:6em; max-height:100px;" />
</td>
<td>
<img src="https://cdn.drexelforchrist.com/formatting/logo/RGB_prayer_value.svg" alt="Value" style="height:6em; max-height:100px;" />
</td>
<td>
<img src="https://cdn.drexelforchrist.com/formatting/logo/RGB_training_value.svg" alt="Value" style="height:6em; max-height:100px;" />
</td>
<td>
<img src="https://cdn.drexelforchrist.com/formatting/logo/RGB_discipleship_value.svg" alt="Value" style="height:6em; max-height:100px;" />
</td>
<td>
<img src="https://cdn.drexelforchrist.com/formatting/logo/RGB_outreach_value.svg" alt="Value" style="height:6em; max-height:100px;" />
</td>
<td>
<img src="https://cdn.drexelforchrist.com/formatting/logo/RGB_community_value.svg" alt="Value" style="height:6em; max-height:100px;" />
</td>
</tr>
</table>

(Note that in this case the Value orientation was used, because multiple classes are used together.) 

The class should be used which best reflects the content of the piece.  If the piece represents multiple values or Drexel Students for Christ in general, the Community class should be used. 

### Modifications to Logo Color

The *text* colors of the Wide orientation may be altered if appropriate for the project.  

**The colors within the Icon and Value orientations (and the Icon portion of the Wide orientation) should not be changed.**  However, the colors of the Icon may be reduced to a single color if and only if (A) either the medium demands it (for instance, a single-color print on a t-shirt), or (B) The full color logo is presented elsewhere in the design and the reduced version is only being used as a decorative accent (such as the back/grey background of the business cards printed circa 2014). 
 
All orientations, in all classes are available in the Media Kit in standard color spaces: RGB, CMYK and Greyscale.  Always use the colorspace appropriate for the project.  This is most important for print, where contrast is particularly important.  Also, make sure the editing software being used supports the appropriate color space. 

For more on the colors used in our identity, see the Colors section below. 

### Placement 

Generally, the logo should never be specifically outlined or placed alone in a box.  A subtle outer glow may be used if needed to increase contrast and legibility, as well as methods described below. 

Details for placement within emails are covered in the Email Guidelines section further along in this document. 

#### Display Media &amp;amp; Ads

In most display and print advertising, the logo should occupy the bottom right corner.  For printed materials which take a booklet form, the logo should be placed at or near the bottom center on the back.  Always ensure there is sufficient padding, and, if designing for print, consider any printing margins that may occur. 
 

#### Print Documents &amp;amp; Printed Correspondence

Generally, the Drexel Students for Christ letterhead should be used for print documents.  The letterhead (Version 3) is built into the website templating.  To print a page on letterhead, just print the webpage from a compliant browser on a printer capable of borderless printing.  (As of this writing, the best results come from printing in Firefox.) 
 
If absolutely necessary, a Word Document template with an older version (version 2) of the letterhead is available in the Media Kit.
 
#### Presentation Slides

The logo is not required on slides beyond the Welcome slide.  In fact, tbe best practice would generally avoid them.  

## Typographic Guidelines

Drexel Students for Christ primarily uses three specific fonts.  There is significant freedom available to the designer in regards to fonts, but all fonts should always be used carefully, with awareness that font provides the tone of written communication.  

### Novecento Wide

The Novecento Wide font family is the primary display typeface for headings and other prominent text.  It is a strong, but approachable font, and should be associated with hallmark Drexel Students for Christ activities, such as Large Groups and Small Groups.  [Novecento Wide is available here](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/novecento-wide). 

### Cabin

The Cabin font family is used for all blocks of text in standard media.  It should be used for worship lyrics in slides and print, standardized documents, forms, and is used as the standard body text throughout the website. [Cabin is available here](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/cabin).

### Edwardian Script ITC

Used only occasionally, Edwardian Script ITC is the default font for scripty text.  It comes with many Microsoft product, or [is available here](https://www.fonts.com/font/itc/itc-edwardian-script). 

## Structural Guidelines

This section will explain the particular guidelines associated with various categories of Drexel Students for Christ media, as well as defining the general DNA of Drexel Students for Christ design.  Please adhere to these standards as much as possible; they are established to maintain visual integrity and ensure project consistency between designers and across ministry generations.  There is room for variation and creativity within categories, though some are bound to more rigorous guidelines than others.  

### General Elements

Clean, Clear, Crisp

Simple geometric shapes

Bold, bright (not over-saturated colors)

Light and Lightweightness

Minimal effects and filters

### Core Media

These are the ministry's front line; the things people see when they're first introduced to Drexel Students for Christ.  This includes any fliers, slides, and any other artwork designed to inform the campus or general public about core events that are integral to the character of Drexel Students for Christ.  Because these events are integral to the character of Drexel Students for Christ, representing them well is integral to the visual identity of Drexel Students for Christ.  

The official typefaces must be used in Core Media. Layouts are moderately flexible, but should be recognisable familiar, and should follow precedent.  (If you believe there to be no precedent for a piece of Core Media, you are mistaken.)  The logo must be used as specified in this guide.  Filters and effects should be extremely subtle or absent. 

### Secondary Event Media

There are any fliers, slides, and other images and documents geared toward informing the campus or general public about standalone or relatively irregular events.  These must balance between forming a design identity of their own that differentiates from Core Media, while continuing to respect the context and identity of Drexel Students for Christ.  

All artwork for a particular event should be consistent across media.  

More freedom is afforded in these designs and functionally-appropriate humor is also permissible.  Adhering to the general guidelines is still preferred. 

## Email Guidelines

Email should always be used sparingly, and should always be accurate so as to prevent the sending of correction emails later.


## Colors

A full list of the colors used as part of the Drexel Students for Christ logo are included in the Media Kit.  While designers are welcome to use any natural color they deem appropriate (neon colors, for instance, are not natural and are never appropriate), they may wish to consider using colors within the branding, particularly if addressing different values.
